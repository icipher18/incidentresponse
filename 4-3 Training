Training

Once an incident response policy and related procedures have been documented, reviewed, and approved, it is important that all personnel receive training related to their responsibilities. All personnel should understand the activities that they must perform. Of equal importance, personnel should understand activities that they must not perform. Training should include simulations to ensure that all personnel are prepared to act. Simulations also help to validate that the incident response procedures are effective and not missing vital details that will be needed when an incident occurs.
Incident Response Tools

In addition to ensuring that the incident response policy and procedure are well documented, organizations must ensure that incident response tools have been acquired. Specific software may be needed for incident-handling activities such as forensics analysis. This type of software should be evaluated and purchased so that it is available when needed.
