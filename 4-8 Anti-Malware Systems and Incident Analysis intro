Anti-Malware Systems

Today, anti-malware systems may be deployed at various points throughout the enterprise. They are installed on individual hosts, on key systems such as e-mail servers, and even at key points in the network in e-mail and web gateways as well as unified threat management (UTM) devices, which combine anti-malware with other functions (such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention, and content filtering).

To remain effective, anti-malware solutions require continual updates and must be monitored to ensure they are still active and effective. Each implementation should be monitored to ensure that updates are received and active. Likewise, the anti-malware engines should be configured to take advantage of automatic scanning for new media and e-mail attachments. Scanning should be scheduled and accomplished on a regular basis. It is best for the scanning to be done automatically during nonpeak usage times.
Security Information Event Management (SIEM)

Few solutions are more important to security operations than one that provides the ability to get a view into security-related events in real time. System audit logs collect valuable information on the operation of the system, but logs do not alert security professionals. They also do not provide ways to collate audit logs across multiple systems.

Security-related audit logs will typically log access attempts (including successes and failures), the use of privileges, service failures, and the like. Even on a single system, these logs can get to be very large. They may need to be tuned to ensure that you are only collecting the logs that you want using appropriate clipping levels. For example, successful login attempts may not be required for analysis and may be filtered out.

One disadvantage of system logs is that they provide a view into that single system. They do not provide a view into events that may be affecting multiple systems or where multiple systems have some information that may be required to detect an incident and track it back to its sources.

Security Information Event Management (SIEM) solutions are intended to provide a common platform for log collection, collation, and analysis in real time to allow for more effective and efficient response. They can also provide reports on historical events using log information from multiple sources. Log management systems are similar: they also collect logs and provide the ability to report against them, although their focus tends to be on historical analysis of log information, rather than real-time analysis. They may be combined with SEIM solutions to provide both historical and real-time functions.

In both cases, log information must be carefully managed, and security operations must maintain a disciplined practice of log storage and archiving. For most SEIM or log management systems, there is a practical limit to the amount of information they can analyze at once or generate reports against. For most systems, only a fraction of the logs will be stored online with the remaining logs moved into longer-term storage or archival solutions.

These solutions store online logs for 30 to 180 days, shift them into an online or near-line archive for up to a year, and then move any logs into longer-term backup to cover the remainder of the retention period. At the end of that period, security operations are responsible for ensuring that old log information is properly disposed of using defined data disposal procedures and tools. Modern reporting tools can also be used to transform security event information into useful business intelligence. Rather than focusing on basic log analysis, they tend to focus on higher level reporting on service metrics as well as reporting for compliance purposes.
Incident Analysis

We can go back and analyze information over time based on how
long the log files go back and how much information we may have captured.
Incident analysis.
It's going to be very important.
It allows us to go through and to focus on the understanding that we need to
generate in order to clearly identify what has happened,
how it's happened, when it happened,
who was responsible, where it took place,
and ultimately, why it took place.
These are the five Ws and the H.
Questions that we often talk about and we probably have all
learned about from the time we were very
small and have been told time and again over the years,
important to ask those questions to get answers to them.
Incident analysis helps us to deal with
the information put in its proper context and frame and answer those questions.
So it's very important for us to understand what we're facing,
so we know how to respond to it. 

Incident analysis focuses on understanding what constitutes an incident in the organization instead of drive-by scans, abnormal behavior, or new system configurations. The incident response team must be able to understand what “normal” behavior is for an organization. “Normal” behavior is based not only on day-to-day activities but also on business cycles and events that affect the business behavior such as mergers and acquisitions.

For example, if an organization has a quarterly reporting requirement to outside entities, “normal” behavior would include increased traffic to those entities during the reporting cycles.

Similarly, e-commerce sites experience an increase in traffic and transactions during holidays. While studying alerts and logs throughout time is useful, understanding the business and the mission of the organization will greatly help the incident response team understand what is normal.

Incident analysis also relies on a sound understanding of the organization’s technology. The incident response team should profile each system and understand the critical system files and sensitive information each contains. They should then develop ways of comparing the established profiles against expected behaviors. One way to do this is using integrity checking software. The incident response team must work with the information system owner and in some cases the information owner to determine which files and information are the most critical and then place those files under integrity monitoring. The incident response team should then participate in the change management process of the organization to ensure any changes to the system and information are noted. Should a critical file or information change outside of authorized processes, the integrity software should send an alert to the incident response team for action.

Incident analysis also depends on the ability to accurately and thoroughly coordinate events between different systems. This necessitates the use of synchronized host clocks. All host systems should have their clocks synchronized to a common time source through network time protocol (NTP.) From an evidence standpoint, this ensures consistent times tamps in the logs rather than having to explain how each system had a slightly different clock. Event correlation may be based on numerous indicators such as username, IP address used, or attack signature. Having the ability to reach across all hosts to search for indicators is invaluable.
