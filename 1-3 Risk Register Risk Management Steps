Risk Register Risk Management Steps

The Risk Register addresses risk management in four key steps:

1. Identifying the risk

2. Evaluating the severity of any identified risks

3. Applying possible solutions to those risks

4. Monitoring and analyzing the effectiveness of any subsequent steps taken
Risk Management Concepts

While reviewing risk management concepts, it is critical to remember that the ultimate purpose of information security is to reduce risks to organizational assets to levels that are deemed acceptable by senior management. Information security should not be performed using a “secure at any cost” approach. The cost of controls should never exceed the loss that would result if the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system were compromised. Risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts should be assessed. Only after assessing these factors can cost-effective information security controls be selected and implemented that eliminate or reduce risks to acceptable levels.
