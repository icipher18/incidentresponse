Incident Records

According to NIST SP 800-61 Rev2, the records should minimally contain:

■■ The current status of the incident (new, in progress, forwarded for investigation, resolved, etc.)

■■ Summary of the incident

■■ Indicators related to the incident

■■ Other incidents related to this incident

■■ Actions taken by all incident handlers on this incident

■■ Chain of custody, if applicable

■■ Impact assessments related to the incident

■■ Contact information for other involved parties (e.g., system owners, system administrators)

■■ A list of evidence gathered during the incident investigation

■■ Comments from incident handlers

■■ Next steps to be taken (e.g., rebuild the host, upgrade an application)
Assessing Risk

The next step in the analysis is to determine the risk of the incident. Not all incidents warrant immediate action, and not all incidents warrant a notification. The incident response team must work with relevant stakeholders such as the information system owner, the information owner, the CISO, the CIO, and legal counsel to determine the impact of a breach. If a breach involves personally identifiable information (PII), notifications may need to be sent out. Incident risk is often reported as high, moderate, or low.
Response

When an incident is detected, a containment strategy must be decided. Containment may include disconnecting devices from the network, shutting systems down, or redirecting traffic around an affected area of the network.
Containment Strategy Considerations

The containment strategy should be driven by several criteria, including the:

■■ Need to preserve forensic evidence for possible legal action

■■ Availability of services the affected component provides

■■ Potential damage leaving the affected component in place may cause

■■ Time required for the containment strategy to be effective

■■ Resources required to contain the affected component
