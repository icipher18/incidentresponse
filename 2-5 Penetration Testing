Penetration Testing

Penetration testing takes vulnerability assessment one step farther. It does not stop at identifying vulnerabilities; it also uses those vulnerabilities to expose other weaknesses in the network. Penetration testing consists of five different phases:

■■ Phase 1: Preparation

■■ Phase 2: Information gathering

■■ Phase 3: Information evaluation and risk analysis

■■ Phase 4: Active penetration

■■ Phase 5: Analysis and reporting
Penetration Testing Modes

Penetration testing also has three different modes. Those modes are:

■■ White box / hat: Tester has complete knowledge of the systems and infrastructure being tested

■■ Gray box / hat: A hybrid between white and black box; this mode can vary greatly

■■ Black box / hat: Assumes no prior knowledge of the systems or infrastructure being tested
