Creating a Risk Register

If you are unsure how to create a Risk Register, the following is a brief guide on how to get started in just a few steps:

1. Create the Risk Register: Use a spreadsheet to document necessary information.

2. Record active risks: Keep track of active risks by recording them in the Risk Register along with the date identified, date updated, target date, and closure date. Other useful information to include is the risk identification number, a description of the risk, type and severity of risk, its impact, possible response action, and the current status of risk.

3. Assign a unique number to each risk element: This will help to identify each unique risk so that you know what the status of the risk is at any given time.
