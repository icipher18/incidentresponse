Packet Sniffers

Once hosts have been identified and correlation has pieced together a partial event, packet sniffers are an invaluable tool to pull additional data. Packet sniffers (also called full-packet capture devices) keep a copy of every packet that crosses a specified point in the network. The most common locations for packet sniffers are on the consolidated ingress/egress network locations and in some cases on local hosts. Sniffers are limited by their amount of storage, so pulling packet capture related to specific hosts should be started as soon as possible once an incident is discovered. Incident responders must also be aware of the privacy implications of packet sniffing. Since all packet traffic is captured, the SSCP may be able to view personal sensitive information unrelated to the incident. To avoid privacy complications, incident response teams should consult with appropriate legal counsel regarding the use of the technology and any checks and balances that may need to be in place.
